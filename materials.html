            <h2>Yarn</h2>
            <img class="img-float-left" src="img/Yarn.jpeg" alt="Yarn">

            <p class="columnP">Yarn comes in many types and thicknesses, known as weights, ranging from fine lace to
                jumbo.
                Beginners are best off starting with medium-weight (worsted) yarn in a light color, as it's easy to work
                with and makes stitches more visible. Different weights create different textures and are suited to
                various
                projects—from delicate lace items to chunky blankets.</p>
            <br>





            <h2>Crochet Hook</h2>
            <img class="img-float-left" src="img/Hooks.jpeg" alt="Crochet Hook">
            <p class="columnP">A crochet hook is your main tool, and size matters. Beginners typically start with a size
                H/8
                (5mm) hook—it pairs well with medium-weight yarn and is easy to handle. Hooks come in different
                materials
                like metal, plastic, or bamboo, so choose what feels comfortable.</p>
            <p class="columnP">
                Yarn and hook sizes are closely related. Each yarn weight works best with certain hook sizes—for
                example,
                worsted weight pairs well with a 5mm hook, while finer yarns need smaller hooks and bulkier yarns need
                larger ones. Yarn labels usually suggest a hook size to help you get the right tension and look.</p>
            <br>




            <h2>Scissors</h2>
            <img class="img-float-left" src="img/Scissors.jpeg" alt="Scissors">
            <p class="columnP">A small, sharp pair of scissors is essential for cutting yarn cleanly and precisely. Look
                for
                ones that are easy to handle and fit well in your crochet kit. While any sharp scissors will work, craft
                scissors with a fine tip make it easier to snip close to your work without fraying the yarn. Keeping a
                dedicated pair just for yarn can help maintain their sharpness over time.</p>
            <br>



            <h2>Tapestry Needle</h2>
            <img class="img-float-left" src="img/Needles.png" alt="Tapestry Needle">
            <p class="columnP">A tapestry needle is a large, blunt needle used to weave in yarn ends and sew pieces
                together. Its wide eye makes threading yarn easy, and the blunt tip lets it glide through stitches
                without
                splitting the fibers. These needles come in metal or plastic, straight or bent-tip styles—bent tips can
                be
                especially handy for weaving through tight spots in your crochet fabric.</p>
            <br>




            <h2>Stitch Markers (Optional)</h2>
            <img class="img-float-left" src="img/Stitch Markers.png" alt="Stitch Markers">
            <p class="columnP">Stitch markers help keep track of important spots in your work—like the beginning of a
                round,
                a turning point, or a specific stitch pattern. They’re especially useful in circular projects or more
                complex designs. You can buy locking markers made for crochet or use simple items like safety pins,
                bobby
                pins, or even scrap yarn. They’re a small tool that can save you a lot of confusion!.</p>
