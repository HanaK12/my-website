            knot, chain,

        <p>To complete a slip knot:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a loop at the end of the yarn with the short end underneath and the continuous part on top.</li>
            <li>Insert your right pointer finger and thumb into loop.</li>
            <li>At the same time, use your left hand to hold onto the short end of the yarn to ensure that the loop does
                not come undone.</li>
            <li>Now, use your right pointer finger and thumb to grab the continuous end of the loop.</li>
            <li>Pull the continuous end of the yarn through the loop and let it tighten.</li>
            <li>Lastly, insert your hook into the loop and pull the short end of the yarn unti the loop closes on your
                hook.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <li>Grasp the short end of the yarn in your left hand with your thumb and middle finger. Have the continous end of the yarn loop up and over your pointer finger so that it drapes down the back of your fingers.</li>
