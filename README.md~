# my-website
## By Hana Knight

This is a website about my hobby of crochet.

Things I will do to improve my website:

1. Add more images or graphics on the Basic Stitches and Easy Patterns page
2. Turn the links on the nav bar into buttons or make the hover effect more interesting.

Things I did to improve my website:
1. Added a table to the Basic Stitches page to improve interactivity and simplify navigation
2. Added a pop-out hover effect to the nav bar links
3. Added images to each stitch on the Basic Stitches page to keep the reader engaged and add more information
4. Added more fontawesome icons to the Easy Patterns Page to keep the reader engaged and add visual guidance.
