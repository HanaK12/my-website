            Hi all! I have been crocheting for about five years. I love crocheting because it
            lets my creativity flow into a beautiful creation thatI will be able to look back on and appreciate.
            My love
            for crochet has inspired me to create this website so that other artists who are interested in crochet will
            be able to access all the information they need all in one place! This website strives to take all
            of the knowledge and resources needed to begin a hobby ins crochet and put it all in one easy to navigate
            website!

            <h2 id="hdr">My Favorite Crochet Projects</h2>
            <!--For now, I am using AI images, but later, I hope to upload some of my own images-->
            <img id="img1" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Doll.jpg" alt="Imge of Crochet Snow White"
                width="300px" />
            <p id="p1">This is my crocheted version of Snow White, lovingly handmade using the pattern by Que Que
                Crochet. From her iconic blue and yellow dress to her signature red bow, every stitch was a joy to make.
                She is my favorite project because of her vibrant colors that really make her stand out. If you'd like
                to try making her yourself, the link to the original pattern video can be found on the Patterns page.
            </p>
            <img id="img2" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Santa.jpg"
                alt="Image of small crochet ornaments of Santa and Mrs. clause " width="300px" />
            <p id="p2">I crocheted this tiny Santa and Mrs. Claus as ornaments, featuring Santa’s classic red suit and
                fluffy beard, and Mrs. Claus with her neat little bun and warm smile. Their simple, soft designs,
                cheerful faces, and traditional colors bring a cozy, festive feel to the tree, and working on the small
                details was a fun challenge. They’ve quickly become two of my favorite handmade holiday decorations.</p>
            <img id="img3" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Peas.jpg" alt="Image of two crochet peas in a pod"
                width="300px" />
            <p id="p3">I crocheted these two little peas in a pod as a special gift for my friend and her brother, with
                each pea featuring a sweet face and fitting snugly side by side in their soft green pod to represent how
                close they are—always together, just like peas in a pod. This simple, cute duo perfectly captures the
                special connection they share.</p>
            <img id="img4" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Hedgehog.jpg" alt="Image of a small crocheted hedgehog"
                width="300px" />
            <p id="p4">I crocheted this little hedgehog keychain as a gift for my sister, using a great YouTube tutorial
                with an easy, portable pattern. The textured yarn gave it fun, soft “spines,” and the contrast with the
                smooth body made it extra cute. Adding the tiny face and feet was a fun challenge that gave it a unique,
                charming personality.</p>
            <img id="img5" class="scale_img" src="img/CrochetStrawberry.jpg"
                alt="Image of a crochet strawberry on a black backpack" width="300px" />
            <p id="p5">I crocheted this sweet little strawberry for my sister’s backpack, using soft yarn in bright red
                with a leafy green top that could attatch to her backpack as a keychain. It’s lightweight and perfectly
                sized to add a cheerful pop of color without weighing down her bag. Simple and fun to make, the shaping
                and textured leaves give it a fresh, lively look and a touch of handmade charm she now carries
                everywhere.
            </p>
            <img id="img6" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Coco.jpg"
                alt="Image of a crochet red Coco Mug with a cute face and marshmallows" width="300px" />
            <p id="p6">I crocheted this cozy cup of cocoa as a Christmas gift for a dear friend, featuring a bright red
                cup topped with soft, fluffy marshmallows and a sweet, smiling face that gives it a cheerful
                personality. The simple pattern was fun to work on, and adding the little details—like the pillowy
                marshmallows and warm expression—made it feel extra special. It’s a small, handmade piece that captures
                the comfort of a winter treat and the joy of sharing something heartfelt during the holidays.

            <img id="img7" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Owl.jpg" alt="Image of a wonky looking crocet owl"
                width="300px" />
            <p id="p7">This wonky owl was my third-ever crochet project, made five years ago when I was just starting
                out, and it holds a special place in my heart. Its uneven shape and quirky little details show how far
                I’ve come, and looking back, I’m proud of every stitch—even the ones that didn’t turn out
                perfectly. It is a treasured keepsake that still brings a smile every time I see it.
            </p>
            <img id="img8" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Cell.jpg" alt="Image of a crochet cell throw pillow"
                width="300px" />
            <p id="p8">I crocheted this detailed cell model for my biology class, designing the pattern myself to
                accurately represent each organelle with unique shapes and textures. It deepened my understanding of
                cell biology and made studying more hands-on and fun. Plus, it doubles as a soft, quirky throw
                pillow—both educational and cozy!</p>
