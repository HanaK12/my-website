            Hi all! I have been crocheting for about five years. I love crocheting because it
            lets my creativity flow into a beautiful creation thatI will be able to look back on and appreciate.
            My love
            for crochet has inspired me to create this website so that other artists who are interested in crochet will
            be able to access all the information they need all in one place! This website strives to take all
            of the knowledge and resources needed to begin a hobby ins crochet and put it all in one easy to navigate
            website!

            <!--For now, I am using AI images, but later, I hope to upload some of my own images-->
            <img id="img1" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Doll.jpg" alt="Imge of Crochet Snow White"
                width="300px" />
            <p id="p1">This is my crocheted version of Snow White, lovingly handmade using the pattern by Que Que
                Crochet. I followed their detailed and easy-to-follow YouTube tutorial, which brought this classic
                fairytale princess to life with beautiful, vibrant colors and adorable details. From her iconic blue and
                yellow dress to her signature red bow, every stitch was a joy to make. She is my favorite project
                because of her vibrant colors that really make her stand out. If you'd like to try making her yourself,
                the link to the original pattern video can be found on the Patterns page.</p>
            <img id="img2" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Santa.jpg" alt="Image of small crochet ornaments of Santa and Mrs. clause "
                width="300px" />
            <p id="p2">This tiny Santa and Mrs. Claus were so fun to crochet and make the cutest holiday pair. I made
                them as ornaments, complete with Santa’s classic red suit and fluffy beard, and Mrs. Claus with her neat
                little bun and warm smile. They bring such a cozy, festive feel to the tree! I kept the designs simple
                and soft, focusing on their cheerful faces and traditional colors. Working on such small details was a
                fun challenge. They’ve quickly become two of my favorite handmade holiday decorations.</p>
            <img id="img3" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Peas.jpg" alt="Image of two crochet peas in a pod"
                width="300px" />
            <p id="p3">I crocheted these two little peas in a pod as a special gift for my friend and her brother. Each
                pea has a cute and sweet face and fits snugly side by side in their soft green pod. They’re meant to
                represent how close the two of them are—always together, just like peas in a pod. This little duo
                perfectly captures the special connection they share.

                It was such a fun and meaningful project to make. I loved adding the little expressions to give them
                personality. Simple, cute, and full of love!</p>
            <img id="img4" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Hedgehog.jpg"
                alt="Image of a small crocheted hedgehog" width="300px" />
            <p id="p4">I crocheted this charming little hedgehog keychain as a special gift for my sister, using a
                wonderful video tutorial I discovered on YouTube. The pattern was easy to follow and perfect for
                creating a small, portable piece of handmade art. This hedgehog is compact and lightweight, making it
                ideal for attaching to keys, backpacks, or purses.

                I enjoyed working with the textured yarn to mimic the hedgehog’s spines, which adds a fun tactile
                element to the design. The soft body contrasts nicely with the tiny “quills,” giving it a cute and
                realistic feel without being prickly. Crocheting the little face and feet was a joyful challenge—adding
                personality and charm that make this keychain truly one-of-a-kind.</p>
            <img id="img5" class="scale_img" src="img/CrochetStrawberry.jpg"
                alt="Image of a crochet strawberry on a black backpack" width="300px" />
            <p id="p5">I crocheted this sweet little strawberry for my sister to decorate her backpack. It’s bright red
                with tiny embroidered seeds and a fresh green leafy top, made with soft yarn that feels nice to the
                touch. The size is just right—not too big or heavy—so it adds a fun pop of color without weighing down
                her bag.

                Making the strawberry was a simple and enjoyable project, focusing on shaping and adding small details
                like the leafy crown. I love how the texture of the leaves gives it a fresh, lively look. It’s become a
                cute, cheerful accessory she carries everywhere, adding a bit of handmade charm to her everyday style.

            <img id="img6" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Coco.jpg" alt="Image of a crochet red Coco Mug with a cute face and marshmallows"
                width="300px" />
            <p id="p6">I crocheted this charming cup of cocoa as a Christmas gift for a dear friend. The cozy red cup is
                topped with fluffy white marshmallows, each carefully crafted to give a soft, pillowy look. Adding a
                cute, smiling face to the cup made it extra special and full of personality—almost like a little holiday
                buddy you can carry around!

                Making this piece was such a joyful project, combining simple shapes with fun details to capture the
                warmth and comfort of a classic winter treat. It’s a small, handmade reminder of the season’s coziness
                and the joy of giving. I loved imagining my friend enjoying a warm cup of cocoa while holding onto this
                cheerful, crochet version all through the holidays.</p>
            <img id="img7" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Owl.jpg" alt="Image of a wonky looking crocet owl"
                width="300px" />
            <p id="p7">This wonky owl holds a special place in my heart as my third ever crochet project, made five
                years ago when I was just starting out. Its charmingly imperfect shape and quirky little details remind
                me of how far I’ve come since those early stitches. Though it’s a bit uneven and “wonky,” that only adds
                to its character and nostalgia.

                Looking back, I’m proud of every stitch, even the ones that didn’t turn out perfectly. This little owl
                reminds me that creativity is about progress, not perfection. It will always be a fun and meaningful
                part of my crochet journey. Working on this owl taught me important skills and gave me the confidence to
                keep crocheting. It’s a
                treasured keepsake that captures the joy and excitement of learning something new, and it still brings a
                smile every time I see it.</p>
            <img id="img8" class="scale_img" src="img/Crochet Cell.jpg" alt="Image of a crochet cell throw pillow"
                width="300px" />
            <p id="p8">I crocheted this detailed cell model for my biology class, and I designed the entire pattern
                myself. Each part of the cell—the nucleus, mitochondria, and other organelles—is carefully crafted to
                represent their real-life counterparts, using different shapes and textures to help visualize how cells
                function. Creating the pattern from scratch was a rewarding challenge that deepened my understanding of
                cell biology and allowed me to combine creativity with science.

                Making the model helped me think critically about cell structure and function while turning complex
                concepts into a tactile, visual learning tool. It’s both an educational piece and a unique handmade
                creation that made studying biology more interactive and fun.</p>
