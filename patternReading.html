  <h1>Pattern Reading</h1>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Abbreviations:</strong> Crochet patterns often use short forms to save space. For example:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ch</strong> = chain</li>
        <li><strong>sc</strong> = single crochet</li>
        <li><strong>dc</strong> = double crochet</li>
        <li><strong>sl st</strong> = slip stitch</li>
        <li><strong>rep</strong> = repeat</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <p>For more detail, Check out the <strong><a href="basicStitches.html">Basic Stitches</a></strong> page.</p>
    <li>
      <strong>Pattern Structure:</strong>
      <p>Each line or row in a pattern gives you step-by-step instructions. Here’s an example:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Row 1: Ch 10. Sc in 2nd ch from hook and in each ch across. (9 sc)<br>
        Row 2: Ch 1, turn. Sc in each st across. (9 sc)
      </blockquote>
      <p>This tells you to make a foundation chain of 10, then work a row of single crochet starting in the second chain from the hook. The number in parentheses at the end shows how many stitches you should have at the end of the row—this helps you double-check your work.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Repeats:</strong>
      <p>Patterns often include repeats to avoid writing out the same steps over and over. These are marked using asterisks (*) or curly brackets {} and followed by instructions on how many times to repeat:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Row 3: *Sc, ch 1* 5 times.
      </blockquote>
      <p>This means you should do "single crochet, chain 1" five times in a row.</p>
      <p>Another version might look like:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Row 4: {sc in next st, skip 1 st, dc in next st} repeat 4 times.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Just follow the steps inside the braces or asterisks as many times as it says.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Parentheses and Brackets:</strong>
      <p>These are used to group parts of a stitch sequence, especially when repeats are involved. For example:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Row 5: *(2 dc in next st, ch 1)* repeat around.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Here, you’ll work 2 double crochets in one stitch, then chain 1—repeating that combination all the way around.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Special Stitches:</strong>
      <p>Some patterns include unique stitches or combinations. These are usually explained in a "Special Stitches" section at the beginning of the pattern. If you see something unfamiliar like “bobble” or “shell,” look for a description near the top or bottom of the pattern.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Always <strong>read through the whole pattern first</strong> before starting.</li>
    <li>Write down and look up the stitches that are new or unknown.</li>
    <li>Keep a list of abbreviations nearby as you work.</li>
    <li>Use a <strong>highlighter or stitch marker</strong> to keep track of your place.</li>
    <li>Don’t worry if it feels tricky at first—it gets easier with practice!</li>
  </ul>
